* Added `./commit-tests.sh` for testing all configurations.
* Added git pre-commit hook to run `commit-tests.sh`.
* Combined duplicate code in the examples into `examples/mqttexample.c`.

* Added Azure IoT hub MQTT client example.
* Added support for MQX / RTCS.

* Fixed build error when using older wolfSSL in firmware examples.
* Updated the get error string function in `mqtt_socket.c` from `wc_GetErrorString` to `wolfSSL_ERR_reason_error_string` so both wolfSSL and wolfCrypt error codes are resolved.
* Added `-n <str>` option so a custom topic name can be used.
* The mqttclient example now listens to stdin and will send a publish message with the data entered on the console when end-of-line (return) is detected (Linux only).
* Added keep-alive ping to the mqttclient and fwclient examples.
* Moved the TLS callback prior to the `client->tls.ctx` creation, allowing the callback function to implement its own client method cert verification.
* Enhanced `MqttClient_WaitMessage` so it will return if we get a message, not just on timeout
* Added make check/test scripts (scripts/client.test and scripts/firmware.test) to validate client TLS (with and without) plus QoS 0-2 levels and the firmware update example.
* Adjusted the example include paths for more flexibility.
* Added new `-T` option for using examples to test.
* Added new `-C` option to allow custom command timeout.

### v0.4 (12/30/2015)

* Removed the LWT from the firmware examples.
* Added retain flag "-r" option on the "fwpush" example.
* Updated the examples to use macros for all memory and string functions, so they are more portable.
* Added Visual Studio projects for "fwpush" and "fwclient".

### v0.3 (11/18/2015)
* Fixes bug with first byte of payload being null'd if QoS level was 0.
* Fixed issue with stdint types (uint#_t) being used.
* Fixes for remaining length encoding/decoding for large packets.
* Added support for large payloads using new message callback flags `msg_done` and `msg_new` along with MqttMessage `buffer_pos` and `buffer_len`.
* Added example for secure firmware upgrade. Uses the MQTT client library to push a signed payload `fwpush` to a broker, then uses another client `fwclient` to receive the signed payload and verify its signature using a provided public key.

* Fixes to handle receival of publish and QoS messages while performing packet writes/waits.
* Added support / tested with Windows.
